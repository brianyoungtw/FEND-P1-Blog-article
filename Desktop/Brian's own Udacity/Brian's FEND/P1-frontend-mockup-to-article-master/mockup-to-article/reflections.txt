Your response goes here!

1. Learned about some tags I haven't used before such as the <sup> tag.
2. HTML is quite easy. Reading the documentation on MDN is quite easy too.
3. So far so good. JS is where it'll start to get harder.
4. Remember the growth mindset - just like weightlifting, you grow muscle (learn things) when it hurts (run into problems)ÔºÅSo don't be afraid of getting stuck, it's actually the perfect chance to improve and grow!
